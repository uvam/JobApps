###———————file_rename.py—Jake McDermott—2017 January———————###
###—this script is for renaming files using a two column CSV file 
###—with the current(old) filenames in the 1st column and the desired
###—name as the second column.

Example files are include for testing in “file_rename_test”.

Successfully tested in 2.7 and 3.6; presumably works in Python version >2.7.
